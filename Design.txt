Basically here is the documentation of how the program should be working

It will store all the to do items in a text file
Once the skin is loaded it should read the text files and then automatically add it to the lists
We might have to use a different scripting language like lua for this purpose

The aesthetics or the vibes should be the 90s kind of like a hacker terminal vibe kind of

Future Direction would be that the list will have an option to add new tasks
There will be an option on the top along with the add new tasks button to remove all the checked tasks
Furthermore, there will be an option to collapse the whole panel or perhaps an ability to hide it and get it back when needed this is to protect the desktop aesthetics
An ability to sort all the tasks based on due dates, ability to make the tasks static so that its prio can only be changed by the user

Each task will have a due date
Each task will have a checkbox to show that it is completed
Each task will have a button to move the priority as each task have different priority
