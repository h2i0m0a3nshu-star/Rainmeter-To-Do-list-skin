Basically here is the documentation of how the program should be working

The aesthetics or the vibes should be the 90s kind of like a hacker terminal vibe kind of

A Task can be treated as a class here or maybe a struct
Task Attributes
    - Task Message
    - Due date
    - Priority
    - Status

Basic storage of the task
    - It will store the tasks in a txt file
    - The txt file once loaded will only be checked back when an add task command will be performed
    - Once the skin has been loaded lua will use an initialize function to load the tasks in the memory and then 
      the tasks will be formated for the 
    - Each task Attribute will be stored by a seperation in between
        Example: Status|Task Message|Due date|Priority

Now the command general formats for this terminal would be 

    CMD "Message or comment"

basic commands required for this terminal
ADD     - CMD to add a task to the list
        : Arguments required : Task Note, Due date, priority (default to the lowest)

RM      - CMD to remove a task from the list
        : Arguments required : Task priority number

CP      - CMD to change the priority of the task
        : Arguments required : Task current priority number, new priority number
